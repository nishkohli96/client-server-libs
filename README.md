## Features

## Get Started

The code for shared packages are in the `packages` folder & the applications code in the `apps` folder.

Install `node_modules`

```bash
yarn
```

Build, run, lint or test all your apps in one command thanks to [Turborepo's Pipelines](https://turborepo.org/docs/core-concepts/pipelines)

To build all the shared packages,

```bash
turbo lib:build
```

Each of the applications have common scripts which can be easily executed in parallel by turborepo's pipelines. Add these in `turbo.json`.

| Command | Result |
|-|-|
|`dev`| Run development server |
|`build`| Build the application |
|`start`| Run the production build |
|`prod`| Build the app and then run the build |
|`lint`| Run eslint to fix code |

## Upgrade Dependencies

[npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) is an excellent tool for detecting the latest versions of dependencies and updating them in your `package.json`. It simplifies the process of keeping your project up to date with the latest package versions.

To update all **dependencies** and **devDependencies** across the workspace, run:

```bash
ncu -ws --format group -u
```

Followed by

```bash
turbo build
```
