# Stripe

1.  In Stripe, there are two types of API keys:
    1.  **Publishable Key** (`pk_live_xxx` or `pk_test_xxx`)
        - Used in the frontend (React, Next.js, etc.).
        - Safe to expose publicly.
        - Used for initializing Stripe.js and creating Payment Intents.
        - Cannot be used for sensitive operations like charging a card directly.

    2.  **Secret Key** (sk_live_xxx or sk_test_xxx)
        - Used in the backend (Node.js, Express, etc.).
        - Must never be exposed on the frontend.
        - Used to process payments, create subscriptions, manage customers, etc.

2.  Add your brand details under the [Branding Section](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding), manage team under the [Teams Section](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/team).

3.  [Statement descriptors](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors) explain charges or payments on bank statements. Using clear and accurate statement descriptors can reduce chargebacks and disputes. They can be configured under the [Business details](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/business-details) section, or can also be configured to each product.

4.  You can create and update products and prices in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products), API or Stripe CLI. Each product has a unique `product_id` and `price_id`, and can have prices in different currencies, including one time and recurring prices. If you want to disable a product so that it canâ€™t be added to new invoices or subscriptions, you can [archive](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices?dashboard-or-api=dashboard&lang=node#archive-product) it. You can only delete products that have no prices associated with them.

5.  If you have a very large product catalog, use the Products API to import your catalog programmatically. If youâ€™re importing your product catalog to Stripe, you can use anything as your starting data source, like a product management system or CSV file.

6.  You can search for prices, users, invoices etc. using different filters in the [dashboard searchbar](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/search#search-filters-operators).

7.  Stripe has a rate limit of **100 parallel requests per second** for `live mode` transactions, and **25 parallel requests per second** for `test mode` transactions.â€‹

8.  `tiers_mode` is a property in [Stripe Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices?lang=node) that allows you to define tiered pricing for a product. This means the price per unit changes depending on the quantity purchased. It has two modes:

    1. `"graduated"` â†’ Pricing follows tiered steps (e.g., first 10 units at $5, next 10 at $4).

        If a customer buys 15 units:
        - First 10 units â†’ $5 each ($50)
        - Next 5 units â†’ $4 each ($20)
        - Total â†’ $70

    2. `"volume"` â†’ Flat pricing per unit based on the total quantity (e.g., if buying 15 units falls in the 10+ range, all units are priced at that tier rate).

        If a customer buys 15 units:
        - Since 15 falls in the 11-20 range, all 15 units are charged at $4 per unit.
        - Total â†’ $60 (15 Ã— $4)

    **Code Snippet**
    ```
    const price = await stripe.prices.create({
      product: 'prod_XXXXXX',
      currency: 'usd',
      billing_scheme: 'tiered',
      tiers_mode: 'graduated' || 'volume',
      tiers: [
        {
          up_to: 10,
          unit_amount: 500
        }, // $5 per unit for 1-10
        {
          up_to: 20,
          unit_amount: 400
        }, // $4 per unit for 11-20
        {
          up_to: null,
          unit_amount: 300
        }, // $3 per unit for 21+
      ],
    });
    ```

10.  Stripe unfortunately doesn't provide **ENUMS**, so they  need to be manually defined by the developer. I've defined them in the [types/stripe](../apps/express-server/src/types/stripe/) folder of `express-server` workspace.

11. Each Stripe API has a [Request-ID](https://docs.stripe.com/api/request_ids?lang=node) which can be captured for logging purpose.

12. The `balance.available` array in Stripe's [Balance API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance?lang=node) is grouped by currency.

    When you retrieve the balance using:

    ```
    const balance = await stripe.balance.retrieve();
    console.log(balance.available);
    ```

    You get an array like this:

    ```
    [
      { "amount": 10000, "currency": "usd", "source_types": { "card": 8000, "bank_account": 2000 } },
      { "amount": 5000, "currency": "eur", "source_types": { "card": 5000 } }
    ]
    ```

    **How is it Grouped?**
    1. **By Currency** â†’ Each object represents a different currency (e.g., `"usd"`, `"eur"`).

    2. **By Payment Method** (Inside `source_types`) â†’ It shows amounts available for each source type, like:
        - `"card"` â†’ Funds from card payments
        - `"bank_account"` â†’ Funds from bank transfers
        - `"fpx"` â†’ FPX payments (Malaysia)

13. [Balance transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions) represent funds moving through your Stripe account. Stripe creates them for every type of transaction that enters or leaves your Stripe account balance. The `Charge` object represents a single attempt to move money into your Stripe account.

    **Every successful charge in Stripe automatically creates a corresponding balance transaction.**

    <h4>ðŸ”¹ How It Works:</h4>

    1. Customer makes a payment (via `charges.create` or Checkout).
    2. A charge (`ch_xxx`) is created, with status `succeeded` (if successful).
    3. Stripe automatically records a balance transaction (`txn_xxx`) linked to the charge.This balance transaction represents the movement of funds into your Stripe account.

14. It is recommended that you create exactly one [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents?lang=node) for each order or customer session in your system. You can reference the **PaymentIntent** later to see the history of payment attempts for a particular session. The value of `paymentIntent.amount`must be a positive integer representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 100 cents to charge $1.00 or 100 to charge Â¥100, a zero-decimal currency).

15.  You can create payment links for products with international pricing, only if your business is registered. Currently to open a stripe account in India, you need to be invited to apply.
