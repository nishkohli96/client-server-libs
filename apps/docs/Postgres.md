# PostgreSQL

1.  **Connect to the DB via shell using:**
    ```
    psql -h your_host -U your_user -d your_database -p your_port
    ```

2.  **Case Sensitivity of table names:**

    PostgreSQL automatically converts unquoted table names to lowercase â†’ `sequelizemeta`. If the table was originally created as "SequelizeMeta", PostgreSQL does not find sequelizemeta, causing an error. Thus `DROP TABLE "SequelizeMeta";` will work but `DROP TABLE SequelizeMeta;` will throw an error as table `sequelizemeta` does not exist.
