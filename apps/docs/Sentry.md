# Sentry

1. You can configure rate limit for a dsn for a particular project. Rate limit will allow only `n` number of events in a particular timeframe. Go to **Client Keys(DSN)** under SDK Setup in project settings. There you can create new keys with a specified rate limit for a particular environment.

2. Similarly you can create custom dashboard under the **Dashboards** section to view unique metrics, either in a form of big number, bar charts, graphs or even tables. Refer [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qY6iaJ0ZEI&list=PLOwEowqdeNMr7wwxSeUChfvxkcvOD4PhW&index=13).
